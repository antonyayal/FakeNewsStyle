## 📌 Overview

**FakeNewsStyle** is a research-oriented framework for **fake news detection in Spanish**, designed with a strong emphasis on **stylistic features** and their interaction with semantic, emotional, readability, and domain-based representations.

This project is being developed as part of a **doctoral research study**, and therefore represents an **evolving research artifact** rather than a finalized production system.

---

## 🎯 Research Motivation

Most fake news detection approaches rely primarily on **semantic representations** derived from large pre-trained language models. However, deceptive content often exhibits **distinctive writing styles**, emotional patterns, and structural cues that are **complementary to semantics**.

This research explores:

- The contribution of **stylistic features** to fake news detection  
- The effectiveness of **multi-feature fusion architectures**  
- The robustness of **style-aware models** across domains  
- The interaction between semantic and non-semantic signals

## 🧠 Proposed Architecture

The proposed architecture follows a **modular, multi-branch design**, where each feature family is extracted independently and later fused for classification.
